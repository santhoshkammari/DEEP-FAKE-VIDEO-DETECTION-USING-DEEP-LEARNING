# DEEP-FAKE-VIDEO-DETECTION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
Deep fake is a method that maps a second person faces to first persons real video and generates same actions the first person does. with deepfake algorithms one can generate
artificial images and videos that humans can't distinguish.
By developing these techniques they made great impact in social and politics, the real danger is because of false information it will create mistrust in people about what they 
hear online.

**OBJECTIVES:**
extract frames from video, filtering the extracted frames like face identification, splitting of data into train and test
A pretrained model is used on training set and model with best accuracy is used to determine wheather the video is real or fake.

**MESONET MODEL:**
